## A/B Testing
Deploy two versions of the software with 
different features. The evaluated features 
are instrumented to measure their success/performance.

## Offer the user to give feedback
- Element in the UI that offers to give feedback
  - Like or dislike?
  - What could be improved? 
  - "Do you find this feature useful?"

## Incidents Reports
**Only measures incidents!**

# Feedback Metrics
- Could be as simple as how many times 
the feature is used.
- User adoption.
- Conversion rate.
- Click-through rate.
- Bounce rate.
